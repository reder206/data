1,"In the contemporary battlefield, the role of an Army officer is ever changing. "
2,The Army’s shifting focus to multi-domain operations is redefining the role of the junior officer and forcing him/her to consider the battlefield in terms beyond their base branch. 
3,"For example, an infantry officer will need to consider the battlefield in terms of artillery, air assets, cyberspace, and the sea in order to effectively do their job. "
4,"This forces officers to think both critically and innovatively and think beyond the operational and tactical levels of warfare even though this remains their primary role, as a junior officer."
5,"The challenges to Army officership in the 21st century involve the Army’s shift in focus to multi-domain operations, which forces officers to consider the battlefield at all three levels of warfare, be both adaptable but doctrinal, and increasingly balance the art of command with the science of control."
6,"My particular skillset allows me to think innovatively and empathetically, empowering my ability to adapt to the changing role of an officer and balance mission command, but I am limited in my physical fitness and confidence in my ability, which can have the opposite effect. "
7,"However, applying the Leader Growth Model (LGM) and developing both a fitness plan and a plan for seeking out uncomfortable situations will improve these weaknesses, which will also improve my readiness to be an officer in the 21st century.  "
8,The most pertinent challenges to officership in the 21st century involve the Army’s shift in focus towards multi-domain operations.
9,"With multi-domain operations and the growing advances in technology come a host of related challenges, balancing mission command with mission control being one of them."
10,"The tenet of multi-domain operations most challenging to a new leader is convergence, which involves “cross-domain synergy, layered options, and mission command/disciplined initiative”."
11,"Cross-domain synergy and layered options must be something in the back of every leader’s mind, including those at the tactical level."
12,"However, these concepts touch into the operational and strategic levels of warfare, which forces fresh lieutenants to consider aspects beyond their branch and echelon and consider the battlefield in terms of all five domains of warfare: space, air, cyberspace, maritime, and land."
13,"Furthermore, this focus demands innovation and creativity, but also forces leaders new to the concept to thoroughly understand doctrine. "
14,With this expanded perspective of the battlefield comes the difficulty in maintaining mission control and its balance with mission command. 
15,"More “space” restricts a leader’s ability to provide direct control, and forces leaders to rely on mission command. Junior officers need to understand the difference between disciplined initiative and disobedience, as well as the ability to understand and brief commander’s intent, which involves both empathy and confidence."
16,"As a leader, one of my most important strengths is my innovative approaches to challenges."
17,"Referencing my Periodic Development Reviews (PDRs), I have received innovation as a “strength” on nine separate instances"
18,"Additionally, I have 12 comments on my innovative ability from instructors, chain of command (CoC), tactical officers (TACs), subordinates, and peers"
19,"All comments have similar themes of a drive to improve the organization regardless of pillar (military or academic), and a creative approach to challenges, of which I have applied to my role as a company executive officer (XO)."
20,"Traditionally, it falls on the XO to create the roommate roster and assist in creating the CoC. "
21,"Individuals in the company put in their preferences for both roommates and their duty position, but this has to be balanced with the needs of the command team."
22,"Historically, XOs manually have to go through the list of preferences and make an educated judgement as to how to allocate people. "
23,"My approach sought to automate the process, creating a fairer way of doing so that involved less work on my part and also balanced each relevant party’s preferences."
24,"Conducting some research, I discovered “Irving’s Algorithm,” which determines the mathematically most compatible solution to preference allocation, which was developed to solve the roommate problem but could be applied to the CoC as well."
25,I wrote some code and solved an issue that normally would take hours of work and leave a majority of people unhappy in about twenty minutes.
26,One of the greatest motivations for this innovation was due to my strength in empathy.
27,"While my PDRs do not immediately reflect this, I feel that many people conflated Interpersonal Tact with Empathy when writing my PDRs."
28,"Across the two, I have 14 positive comments, most of the negative comments being self PDRs , which speaks to my lack of self-confidence"
29,One of the comments written by my TAC states that I “listen and try to understand situations from all angles in order to make informed decisions that best serves the CDT and the Army”
30,which touches on both empathy and innovation.
31,"I feel that these two strengths go hand in hand; my empathy for others motivates me to be innovative in my solutions to problems, and my innovation allows me to better understand."
32,"The two aforementioned strengths directly relate to the challenges of 21st century officership in that multi-domain operations demand innovation, and mission command demands empathy"
33,"Multi-domain operations, by design, demand innovation simply because the concept is novel, forcing the officer to apply doctrine to achieve a commander’s intent, but to do so in an innovative way."
34,"Furthermore, mission command involves empathy travelling both directions in the CoC."
35,"On one hand, as a junior officer, I need to understand my commander’s intent, and to do so is to intimately understand my area of expertise as well as intimately understand my commander."
36,"On the other hand, I also need to understand how others will receive my intent in order to empower my subordinates and offer them a clear left and right limit while also ensuring that the task is completed to standard; both of these aspects necessitate empathy. "
37,These strengths are limited by my weaknesses of confidence and physical fitness. I had identified that physical fitness was one of the biggest weaknesses that I had in my first PDR.
38,"In my first CDR, my team leader (TL) identified that physical fitness was a weakness of mine, but also stated that I had shown improvement from the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester"
39,"Since then, my physical fitness has steadily improved."
40,"However, during Cadet Field Training (CFT), I sustained a stress fracture to my foot, which greatly impeded my ability to improve my physical fitness."
41,"Going into my firstie year, I sustained a tear to my hip flexor muscle, which I am currently doing physical therapy for"
42,This has forced me to put developing my physical fitness on hold while I recover from this injury
43,"As such, physical fitness has always been a struggle for me, but I recognize how I can develop this and am continuing to work through this weakness. "
44,"I also struggle with confidence, which, though I have developed since my plebe year, still requires my attention. "
45,"In this case, I feel that I am more of an introverted person and do not project confidence, and can easily lose confidence, which was identified by my peer"
46,"A personal example of this occurred when I was a CBT SL. During this time, my confidence vastly improved, as I was put in a position where I had to maintain a commanding presence"
47,"However, there were many situations where, upon reflection, I think that I could have done a better job with confidence in the face of failure. "
48,"For example, I was leading physical training (PT) on one occasion, and I made a mistake on the order of preparatory drills (PD)"
49,"At this point in the detail, the NCs knew what the order was, so they knew that I made a mistake, which ultimately caused me to lose faith in my own expertise even though I had a better understanding of how to lead these PT sessions than they did. "
50,"In a situation like this, I needed to do a better job of not letting failure affect me. "
51,"Confidence and physical fitness are the bedrock of officership in the sense that mission command and disciplined initiative demands confidence, and physical fitness is directly correlated to confidence in one’s abilities."
52,"For one, subordinates need to have confidence in their own decision making in order to execute a disciplined initiative."
53, Asking for guidance from the commander every time a subordinate lacks confidence in their own leadership ability fundamentally eliminates a subordinate leader’s role in mission command; it forces commanders to impose greater control over their subordinates and pushes the line away from the balance between absolute command and absolute control. 
54,A basic way to achieve self-confidence is to be physically fit. 
55,"Physical fitness provides oneself an indication of self-discipline and ability, and at a bare minimum, is a means to increasing self-confidence. "
56,"As such, these two weaknesses of are intertwined, and have direct ramifications regarding my ability to be an officer in the 21st century. "
57,Applying the Army’s LGM to developing physical fitness is a natural transition.
58,"Leader growth can be fostered through challenging experiences, new knowledge and capacities, and reflection, through time."
59,"This translates directly to physical fitness. In order to build physical fitness, a person needs to train and push their boundaries, understand how to properly train, and build in time for rest and recovery, which mirrors the LGM."
60,"Pushing boundaries is analogous to challenging experiences, learning how to train is increasing knowledge, and rest and recovery is reflection. "
61,"In order to improve my physical fitness, I am following and will continue to follow a training plan. "
62,"The first step is to overcome my injury; for this, I have a strict physical therapy regimen."
63,"Once my injury heals, I plan on developing a monthly training plan that incorporates each facet of physical fitness, following the principles of programming. "
64,Applying the LGM to developing confidence involves both developing expertise and seeking out new situations/experience.
65,"In order to do this, I need to both develop my sense of self-awareness and increasingly place myself outside of my comfort zone."
66,. One way to achieve greater self-awareness is through constant feedback from others.
67,"Last semester, I required personal, subordinate, and leadership feedback when rating at every level."
68,"Applying this concept to myself, one of my leadership plans is to seek as much feedback from as many people as I possibly can in the form of something similar to a PDR, even if it is not something that directly supports my own evaluation. "
69,"This is a way to develop new knowledge and capacities, and directly leads to reflection."
70,"Upon receiving feedback about myself, it is important to consider the feedback in a reflective way."
71,". I find that the best way to do this is to develop examples of behavior that align with the feedback develop new ways to handle the situation. Over time, this should lead to the development of my confidence. "
72,"The Army’s shift in focus to multi-domain operations forces officers to consider the battlefield at a both a macroscopic and microscopic level, demanding innovation, creativity, and empathy, all of which fall under my personal strengths."
73,"I am limited in my physical fitness and confidence, but by applying the LGM and developing both a fitness plan and increasing my self-awareness, I can improve these weaknesses, which will also improve my readiness to be an officer in the 21st century."
74,Considering personal strengths and weaknesses and how to apply these to the role of an officer in the 21st century is an important step to take as I transition from a cadet to an officer.
75,"Furthermore, reflecting in this way forces me to think critically about the future of the Army and how the Army I enter may not be the Army I exit."
