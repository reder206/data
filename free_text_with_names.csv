,,,Abstract,D2,
,,,The relationship between gender and political aggression is hotly debated and the empirical evidence is often mixed.,E2,
,,,"While many surveys find a gender gap, with women less supportive of politically motivated aggression and violence",F2,
,,,"than men, numerous case studies point to women’s active involvement in political violence and refute the association",G2,
,,,of women with peacefulness. This article argues that the gender–aggression relation depends upon (1) the type of,H2,
,,,"political aggression under study (i.e. direct vs. indirect political aggression), and (2) contextual factors, notably the",I2,
,,,"salience of a protracted conflict. Using original datasets representing Israeli Jews (N ¼ 3,126) we found that in the",A3,
,,,"context of protracted conflict, gender has a unique effect on support for indirect forms of political aggression, over",B3,
,,,"and above other central predictors of political aggression (i.e. political orientation and threat perceptions), such that",C3,
,,,women are actually more supportive of politically motivated social distancing and exclusion of out-groups in conflict,D3,
,,,"as compared to men. Women and men, however, do not differ in their support for direct, politically motivated,",E3,
,,,violent acts against government officials. Results also shed light on potential mechanisms underlying these differences,F3,
,,,"(and lack thereof), in the context of protracted conflict. The findings cast further doubt on the stereotype of ‘peaceful",G3,

,,,of gender differences1 in support for political aggression,,
,,,and violence.2,,
,,,Many new studies examining women’s role as agents,,
,,,of political violence have helped dispel the earlier essentialist,,
,,,assumption about women’s status as either passive,,
,,,victims or peace-promoters in contexts of,,
,,,intranational and international conflict. They show,,
,,,instead that women participate in various ways in political,,
,,,"violence (for just a few examples: Alison, 2007;",,
,,,"Eager, 2008; McDermott, 2015; Bloom, 2012;",,
,,,"Parashar, 2014; Sjoberg & Gentry, 2007; Cunningham,",,
,,,"2003; Gonzalez-Perez, 2008; Henshaw, 2016; Gentry,",,
,,,"2012; Thomas&Bond, 2015). Indeed, women also often",,
,,,create and maintain the social and economic networks,,
,,,"that facilitate and support political violence (Aolain,",,
,,,"Haynes & Cahn, 2011; Cragin & Daly, 2009; McEvoy,",,
,,,"2009; Parkinson, 2013).",,
,,,"Yet, there is also an extensive empirical literature that",,
,,,argues that both in active participation in political violence,,
,,,and in support for the use of force in domestic and,,
,,,"foreign policy, there exists a gender gap. Men are more",,
,,,"involved, numerically, than women as participants in",,
,,,"political violence, and women tend to be less supportive",,
,,,"of policies advocating the use of violence (Pratto,",,
,,,"Stallworth & Sidanius, 1997; Wilcox, Hewitt & Allsop,",,
,,,"1996). Further, studies addressing aggression in general",,
,,,(not only in the political realm) have shown that men,,
,,,"and women express aggression differently, such that men",,
,,,are more physically aggressive while women may find,,
,,,"other non-physical outlets for aggression (Card et al.,",,
,,,"2008; McDermott, 2015). What, then, is the relationship",,
,,,between gender and political aggression?,,
,,,This article examines the role of gender in predicting,,
,,,support for different forms of political aggression,,
,,,using two original datasets representing Israeli Jews,,
,,,"(N ¼ 3,126). We offer three important theoretical",,
,,,suggestions that could help subsequent studies further,,
,,,disentangle the question of gender and political aggression.,,
,,,"First, we argue that national and regional context",,
,,,matters. Much of the public opinion literature that has,,
,,,identified a gender gap – with women being more ‘pacifist’,,
,,,or ‘peaceful’ than men – has drawn on data from the,,
,,,"USA and Europe (Conover & Sapiro, 1993; Eichenberg,",,
,,,"2007; Golan, 2015). In the Middle East and in other",,
,,,"regions, local contextual factors, and in particular the",,
,,,"salience of protracted conflicts, have been found to have",,
,,,a significant role in shaping attitudes towards political,,
,,,"aggression (Canetti et al., 2009). The first goal of this",,
,,,"research is, therefore, to examine the gender gap in support",,
,,,for political aggression in the context of exposure to,,
,,,"violent, protracted intergroup conflict. Second, we propose",,
,,,a more nuanced conceptualization of political,,
,,,aggression which highlights that different kinds of political,,
,,,aggression may associate differently with gender.,,
,,,Most of the existing literature focuses on one of two,,
,,,main forms of political aggression: some studies focus,,
,,,"on direct political aggression, which is conceptualized as",,
,,,support for the use of force (or threat thereof) against,,
,,,political actors (i.e. individuals and institutions representing,,
,,,the state and its bodies) in an attempt to change,,
,,,"a political situation or attain political goals (Feierabend,",,
,,,"Feierabend & Gurr, 1972). Other studies focus on",,
,,,exclusion and social distancing of minorities or political,,
,,,out-groups that are perceived as posing a symbolic or,,
,,,realistic threat to the in-group. Inspired by literature,,
,,,"on interpersonal aggression, we term this form of aggression",,
,,,"indirect political aggression (Feshbach, 1969). Lastly,",,
,,,we examine potential mechanisms that may shed light on,,
,,,the relationship between gender and political aggression,,
,,,in the context of protracted conflict. The current,,
,,,research thus adds important evidence to the critical,,
,,,literature that has questioned the stereotype of ‘peaceful,,
,,,women’ and also contributes to the vast feminist literature,,
,,,on gender and political conflict by offering insight,,
,,,into a significant and less explored pattern of women’s,,
,,,involvement as important agents in conflict.,,
,,,Gender and direct political aggression,,
,,,Women’s active involvement in various forms of violent,,
,,,conflict has challenged the widespread stereotype of,,
,,,"aggressive men and pacifist women. However, women",,
,,,still participate in smaller numbers than men in combative,,
,,,roles or as perpetrators of political aggression,,
,,,"(Goldstein, 2003; Hudson et al., 2009). Moreover, a",,
,,,vast number of public opinion surveys show that women,,
,,,tend to be less supportive than men of policies,,
,,,1 We use the term ‘gender’ here because the political behavior,,
,,,literature we address refers to the ‘gender gap’ as the conventional,,
,,,"term to describe differences between men and women. Of course,",,
,,,what we measure in this article are really differences between people,,
,,,"who self-identify as ‘male’ or ‘female’, rather than gender differences",,
,,,in the sense of socially constructed masculinity and femininity,,
,,,"(Harteveld et al., 2015).",,
,,,2 Psychologists define aggression as ‘behavior directed toward another,,
,,,"individual, carried out with the proximate (immediate) intent to",,
,,,"cause harm’. Violence, on the other hand, is defined as ‘physical",,
,,,aggression at the extremely high end of the aggression continuum’.,,
,,,"Psychologists often assert that all violence is aggression, but not all",,
,,,"aggression is violence (Anderson & Huesmann, 2003: 298). Building",,
,,,"on this view, we see political violence as part of a spectrum of political",,
,,,aggression.,,
,,,734 journal of PEACE RESEARCH 54(6),,
,,,"advocating the use of force in political contexts, particularly",,
,,,on issues related to military interventions and capital,,
,,,"punishment, even when controlling for demographic",,
,,,"factors and political partisanship (Fite, Genest &Wilcox,",,
,,,"1990; Haider-Markel & Vieux, 2008; Nincic & Nincic,",,
,,,"2002; Regan & Paskeviciute, 2003; Togeby, 1994).",,
,,,These findings resonate with consistent findings in,,
,,,psychological studies with regard to the gender gap in,,
,,,"interpersonal aggression, according to which men are",,
,,,more likely than women to engage in physically and verbally,,
,,,"aggressive behaviors (Etxebarria et al., 2003; Tangney",,
,,,"& Dearing, 2002). Psychological scholarship has offered",,
,,,several explanations for these gender differences in aggression.,,
,,,These include human evolutionary history (for a,,
,,,"review, see Buss & Shackelford, 1997), hormonal differences",,
,,,"(Mazur & Booth, 1998; Mehta & Beer, 2010),",,
,,,"social sanction models (Daly & Wilson, 1988; Underwood,",,
,,,"2003; Verona et al., 2007; Hirschberger et al.,",,
,,,"2002), and others.Overall, most studies indicate that men",,
,,,are more likely to externalize their emotions and are thus,,
,,,more likely to engage in ‘fight or flight’ responses under,,
,,,"threatening circumstances, whereas women tend to internalize",,
,,,their emotions and thus engage in ‘tend-andbefriend’,,
,,,"responses (Bjorklund & Shackelford, 1999;",,
,,,"Knight et al., 2002; Verona et al., 2007).",,
,,,The political science literature has also drawn on,,
,,,women’s and men’s different social roles and life experiences,,
,,,to account for the gender gap in support for political,,
,,,aggression. The most widely cited explanations are,,
,,,women’s preference for cooperation and compromise,,
,,,"over aggression as a means for settling disagreements,",,
,,,"maternal ethics of care, and feminist commitments",,
,,,"(Sjoberg & Gentry, 2007; Caprioli & Boyer, 2001;",,
,,,"Melander, 2005; Cole & Coultrap-McQuin, 1992;",,
,,,"Gilligan, 1982; Ruddick, 2009). However, the direction",,
,,,of the gender gap is reversed when the objective of military,,
,,,"interventions is to save innocent lives, or when",,
,,,operations are defined as peacekeeping operations,,
,,,"(Brooks &Valentino, 2011; Eichenberg, 2016).",,
,,,Both the psychological-individual and the more,,
,,,socially constructive political accounts therefore imply,,
,,,almost universal gendered attributes that should transcend,,
,,,differing local contexts in a range of different cultures,,
,,,"and regions. However, a major limitation of this",,
,,,literature is its disproportionate focus on the United,,
,,,"States and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Fewer studies have",,
,,,explored such questions in other regional contexts,,
,,,"(Eichenberg, 2007). Tessler and colleagues (Tessler &",,
,,,"Warriner, 1997; Tessler, Nachtwey & Grant, 1999),",,
,,,"who have looked at the Middle East, did not find any",,
,,,significant difference between men and women in terms,,
,,,of peaceful vs. hawkish preferences with regard to policies,,
,,,"on international conflict, when controlling for feminist",,
,,,"commitments. Regional differences, and in",,
,,,"particular the salience of conflicts in certain contexts,",,
,,,may explain why the association of women with a preference,,
,,,for nonviolence found in research in the USA,,
,,,and Europe may not apply in other regions. The gender,,
,,,gap may be contingent on a certain physical and psychological,,
,,,"distance from violent conflict, or on the nature of",,
,,,the conflict. In protracted conflicts in which all members,,
,,,"of society experience proximity to violence, men’s and",,
,,,women’s attitudes may not display such differences,,
,,,"(Eichenberg, 2016).",,
,,,"The Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which has lasted for",,
,,,"over a century, is a prototypical example of an intractable",,
,,,"conflict: it is protracted, violent, total, and central, perceived",,
,,,"as zero-sum, and imposes high material and psychological",,
,,,"demands on both sides (Bar-Tal & Teichman,",,
,,,2005). Particularly since the eruption of the second Intifada,,
,,,"(Palestinian uprising) in September 2000, in which",,
,,,thousands of Palestinian and Israeli civilians were injured,,
,,,"and killed (B’tselem, 2010), both sides have suffered the",,
,,,worst period of mutual violence since the 1948 war.,,
,,,Alongside Israelis’ deep mistrust towards Palestinians,,
,,,and their growing support for violent acts against them,,
,,,and toward politicians or public officials that advocate,,
,,,"for them (Bar-Tal & Teichman, 2005), there has been a",,
,,,consistent shift in public support toward more conservative,,
,,,"ideologies (Canetti et al., 2009). Indeed, studies",,
,,,have shown that exposure to political violence as well,,
,,,as perception of threat as a result of living in a conflict,,
,,,zone has the effect of hardening political attitudes and,,
,,,increasing support for militancy and violence as opposed,,
,,,"to political compromise (Maoz & McCauley, 2009;",,
,,,"Hirsh-Hoefler et al., 2014).",,
,,,"Following Tessler and colleagues (Tessler & Warriner,",,
,,,"1997; Tessler, Nachtwey & Grant, 1999), we hypothesize",,
,,,"that in political contexts of protracted conflicts, such as",,
,,,"the Middle East, we may not witness a significant gender",,
,,,"gap in support for direct political aggression, meaning the",,
,,,"use of violence for political ends, as had been identified in",,
,,,studies focusing on the USA and Europe.,,
,,,H1: Women and men in Israel do not differ in their,,
,,,support for direct political aggression.,,
,,,Gender and indirect political aggression,,
,,,The psychological literature has suggested that more covert,,
,,,"or indirect forms of aggression, particularly behaviors",,
,,,"aimed at damaging the target’s social relations, are more",,
,,,Ben Shitrit et al. 735,,
,,,"characteristic of women than of men (e.g. Crick, 1997;",,
,,,"Vaillancourt et al., 2003). Such behaviors include",,
,,,"manipulation of peer relationships such as ostracism,",,
,,,"social rejection, and rumor-spreading aimed at damaging",,
,,,"the victim’s self-esteem or social status (Crick, 1997).",,
,,,The conceptual disaggregation of aggression to its direct,,
,,,and indirect components was shown to be highly informative,,
,,,to the study of the gender–aggression association,,
,,,"in interpersonal relationships (Archer, 2004; Underwood,",,
,,,2003).,,
,,,We argue that a similar disaggregation between direct,,
,,,"and indirect political aggression, particularly in the context",,
,,,"of protracted conflict, is required. The proposed idea",,
,,,of indirect political aggression has some overlap with the,,
,,,concepts of political intolerance and xenophobia,,
,,,employed in the political and psychological literatures.,,
,,,"Nevertheless, these manifestations of ‘intolerance’ are",,
,,,usually not conceptualized so as to clarify their relationship,,
,,,"to political aggression. Also, with some exceptions,",,
,,,this literature usually ignores gender altogether or treats,,
,,,it as a control variable rather than a predicting factor,,
,,,"(Golebiowska, 1999; Pratto, Stallworth & Sidanius,",,
,,,"1997; Zick, Ku¨pper & Ho¨vermann, 2011).",,
,,,We hypothesize that women in societies experiencing,,
,,,a salient protracted conflict will be more supportive of,,
,,,indirect political aggression than men. Varying from the,,
,,,biological and social explanations that previous literature,,
,,,"has seen as underlying this gap (e.g. Card et al., 2008;",,
,,,"McDermott, 2015), we offer that these differences can",,
,,,be attributed to the ways in which women are interpolated,,
,,,into particular roles in conflicts that revolve around,,
,,,"group identity, such as nationalist, ethnic, and communal",,
,,,"conflicts. The feminist literature, following Anthias",,
,,,"& Yuval-Davis (1989), has long observed that women",,
,,,often serve as ‘boundary-markers’ between groups in,,
,,,conflict. Dominant nationalist and communalist discourses,,
,,,almost invariably ascribe to women the roles of,,
,,,"biological reproducers of the group, of cultural transmitters",,
,,,"of the group’s identity through the rearing of children,",,
,,,and of the symbolic ‘border guards’ of the,,
,,,boundaries between the in-group and the out-group.,,
,,,"Women’s dress, bodies, conduct, and relationships are",,
,,,"used for the work of distinction and separation, with",,
,,,emphasis on difference and distance from the rival group,,
,,,"(Al-Ali, 2000; Ben Shitrit, 2015; Katz, 2003; Ranchod-",,
,,,"Nilsson & Te´treault, 2003).",,
,,,"In the Israeli–Palestinian context, the continuous",,
,,,exposure to the conflict has led Israelis to become,,
,,,increasingly suspicious and hostile towards Palestinian,,
,,,"citizens of Israel (PCIs) (Hirsch-Hoefler et al., 2014), a",,
,,,minority group portrayed in Israeli discourse as posing a,,
,,,threat to both Israel’s national identity and Israelis’ physical,,
,,,"safety (e.g. Bar-Tal & Teichman, 2005). In the present",,
,,,"study, we examine whether gender predicts support",,
,,,for two forms of indirect political aggression towards,,
,,,"PCIs: exclusionism, defined as the wish to exclude the",,
,,,PCI minority by denying it civil and political rights,,
,,,"(Canetti et al., 2009), and social distance, defined as",,
,,,the desire to maintain social distance and avoid,,
,,,"intimate contact with PCIs (Canetti-Nisim, Ariely &",,
,,,"Halperin, 2008).",,
,,,H2: Israeli women are more supportive than men of,,
,,,indirect political aggression (i.e. exclusionism and,,
,,,social distancing) toward PCIs.,,
,,,The role of political orientation and threat,,
,,,perception in predicting support for political,,
,,,aggression,,
,,,One of the strongest and most widely used predictors of,,
,,,support for political aggression is political orientation,,
,,,"(e.g. Benjamin, 2006; Jost, 2006). Specifically, rightwing",,
,,,ideologies are generally associated with higher hostility,,
,,,"and prejudice toward out-groups and minorities,",,
,,,and higher support for the use of military force (e.g.,,
,,,"Hirsch-Hoefler, Canetti & Pedahzur, 2010).",,
,,,The association between right-wing ideologies and,,
,,,"support for aggression can be attributed, at least in part,",,
,,,"to rightists’ higher perceptual, cognitive, and emotional",,
,,,"sensitivity to threat, and lower tolerance for ambiguity",,
,,,"and uncertainty as compared to leftists (Duckitt, 2013;",,
,,,"Kruglanski &Webster, 1996). As aggression offers hope",,
,,,"for a clear solution to threat-inducing conflict, it is therefore",,
,,,the strategy rightists might opt for in response to,,
,,,threatening stimuli in order to minimize ambiguity and,,
,,,"uncertainty (Jost, Kay & Thorisdottir, 2009).",,
,,,"Threat perceptions, in and of themselves, are considered",,
,,,a strong predictor of support for political aggression,,
,,,"and intergroup hostility, including social distancing and",,
,,,"exclusion of out-groups and minorities (e.g. Halperin,",,
,,,"Canetti-Nisim & Pedahzur, 2007; Huddy et al.,",,
,,,"2005). According to the literature, non-tangible threats",,
,,,"to a group’s beliefs, values or morals may facilitate social",,
,,,"rejection and hostility towards out-groups, even in the",,
,,,absence of realistic threats to the in-group’s resources,,
,,,"(Stephan & Stephan, 2000).",,
,,,The relationship between gender and threat perceptions,,
,,,"and political orientation is, however, quite perplexing.",,
,,,"While in most studies, women report higher levels of",,
,,,"threat perceptions than men (Golebiowska, 1999;",,
,,,"Huddy et al., 2002; Nellis, 2009), studies conducted",,
,,,736 journal of PEACE RESEARCH 54(6),,
,,,since the 1980s consistently show women to be more,,
,,,"supportive of leftist ideologies (Emmenegger & Manow,",,
,,,"2014; Seltzer, Newman & Leighton, 1997). More",,
,,,work is needed to establish whether gender plays a,,
,,,role in predicting support for direct and indirect,,
,,,"aggression, over and above threat perceptions and",,
,,,"political orientation, particularly in the context of",,
,,,"protracted conflict, where both of these tend to",,
,,,"increase. As discussed in the next section, this is the",,
,,,main purpose of the present study.,,
,,,Study 1,,
,,,Study 1 examines the effect of gender on support for,,
,,,"direct and indirect political aggression,3 controlling for",,
,,,two central predictors of political aggression in the context,,
,,,of protracted conflict: political orientation and,,
,,,threat perceptions. Because entrenched conflicts affect,,
,,,"members of society differently than distant, overseas or",,
,,,"far off conflicts, we hypothesize that gender does not",,
,,,predict support for direct political aggression in the context,,
,,,"of protracted conflict, such that women and men do",,
,,,"not differ in their support for direct political aggression,",,
,,,even when controlling for the effects of political orientation,,
,,,"or threat perceptions. By contrast, we expect gender",,
,,,to significantly predict support for indirect political,,
,,,aggression over and above political orientation and threat,,
,,,"perceptions, such that women demonstrate stronger support",,
,,,for indirect aggression as compared to men.,,
,,,"Furthermore, we examine the role of threat perceptions",,
,,,and political orientation as potential mechanisms,,
,,,explaining this hypothesized gender gap in indirect political,,
,,,"aggression, by testing whether the effects of these",,
,,,predictors on support for indirect political aggression is,,
,,,different for men and women (moderation hypothesis).,,
,,,"To this end, we examine whether gender moderates the",,
,,,effects of threat perceptions and political orientation on,,
,,,support for indirect political aggression.,,
,,,Method and measures,,
,,,The data were collected during 2003–05 and obtained,,
,,,"using a random sampling of landlines, to achieve a",,
,,,representative sample of adult Israeli Jews. The final,,
,,,"sample consisted of 2,319 respondents.4 We used a",,
,,,structured questionnaire drawn from several measures,,
,,,that was completed by most participants in approximately,,
,,,20 minutes. All items were rated on a scale ranging,,
,,,"from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree),",,
,,,unless indicated otherwise. All scales were computed,,
,,,by calculation of the average of all items in each scale.,,
,,,Support for direct political aggression5 was measured,,
,,,"using a three-item scale adapted from Pedahzur, Hasisi &",,
,,,"Brichta (2000), tapping participants’ support for (1) sending",,
,,,"threatening letters, (2) using arms, and (3) physically",,
,,,injuring politicians in pursuit of political ends ( ¼ .67).,,
,,,Support for indirect political aggression consisted of,,
,,,two concepts:,,
,,,1. Exclusionism was measured using four items,,
,,,"adapted from Scheepers, Gijsberts & Coenders",,
,,,(2002) to tap participants’ beliefs regarding the,,
,,,required public policy directed at PCIs (see also,,
,,,"Canetti-Nisim, Arieli & Halperin, 2008; e.g.",,
,,,‘PCIs should not be allowed equal social rights,,
,,,"as Jews’; see full items in the Online appendix,",,
,,,Tables 1 and 2). The scale has been found to,,
,,,"have broad, cross-cultural applicability across",,
,,,22 European countries ( ¼ .77).,,
,,,2. Social distance was measured using four items,,
,,,adapted from Crandall’s (1991) Social Distance,,
,,,Questionnaire and adjusted to reflect Israelis’,,
,,,support for socially distancing PCIs: (e.g. ‘would,,
,,,you agree to have a family member romantically,,
,,,involved with a PCI?’; see full items in the,,
,,,"Online appendix, Table 1) ( ¼ .83).",,
,,,Threat perceptions were measured using a three-item,,
,,,"scale that is often used in Israel (e.g. Canetti et al., 2009),",,
,,,tapping three dimensions of threat perceptions toward,,
,,,PCIs: ‘to what extent do you think PCIs pose a threat to:,,
,,,3 The measures of direct and indirect political aggression in this study,,
,,,"did not assess actual participation in acts of political aggression, but",,
,,,rather the attitudinal support of such acts. Although correlations,,
,,,"between attitudes and behaviors are often far from absolute,",,
,,,research in the social sciences has come to rely on attitudinal,,
,,,measures particularly when the direct measurement of behavior is,,
,,,"difficult or impossible, as is the case with participation in acts of",,
,,,"political aggression (Ajzen, 2001; Pedahzur, Hasisi & Brichta, 2000).",,
,,,4 See Online appendix for details about survey sampling and,,
,,,procedure.,,
,,,5 To confirm the discriminant and divergent validity of the direct,,
,,,"political aggression scale, we conducted two exploratory factor",,
,,,"analyses using Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization, for the",,
,,,three items of the direct aggression scale along with the four items,,
,,,"of each of the indirect political aggression scales. As expected, each",,
,,,analysis yielded two components with eigenvalues greater than 1 that,,
,,,accounted for more than 60% of the variance. Loadings (see Online,,
,,,"appendix, Tables 1 and 2) showed that the direct political aggression",,
,,,"items loaded highly onto the first component (> .75), and the indirect",,
,,,political aggression items loaded strongly onto the second factor,,
,,,(> .74 for social distancing and > .69 for exclusion).,,
,,,Ben Shitrit et al. 737,,
,,,"(1) Israel’s security, (2) the democratic character of Israel,",,

,,,salient factors in the context of protracted conflict: militarism,,
,,,and emotions towards the rival in conflict. In the,,
,,,"context of conflict, societies as a whole often become",,
,,,relatively militarized. The extensive literature on militarism,,

,,,women’s and men’s attitudes toward out-groups in conflict,,
,,,"(for a few examples: Adelman, 2003; Cockburn,",,
,,,"2010; Enloe, 2000; McEnaney, 2000; Sjoberg & Via,",,
,,,"2010). In Israel, although women’s positions in the army",,
,,,"remain mostly confined to non-combat roles, their duration",,
,,,"of service is shorter than their male counterparts,",,
,,,and they may be more easily exempted from the army,,
,,,"than men due to marriage or motherhood (Golan,",,
,,,"2015), the fact remains that most Jewish Israeli women",,
,,,"serve in the army and are socialized into a typically masculinist,",,
,,,"certainly hawkish, institution. By conforming to",,
,,,an overwhelmingly masculinist militaristic culture in,,
,,,"their behaviors (Sasson-Levy, 2002) and by going",,
,,,"through the same system of military conscription, Israeli",,
,,,women may also align more closely with their male,,
,,,counterparts in terms of their attitudes towards militarism,,

,,,Long-term intergroup conflicts are also saturated with,,
,,,negative intergroup emotions that powerfully shape society,,
,,,"members’ attitudes and behaviors, including their support",,
,,,"for political aggression (Bar-Tal, Halperin & DeRivera,",,
,,,2007). Although negative emotions towards the rival in,,
,,,"conflict, such as anger and fear, play a major role in initiating",,
,,,"and maintaining intergroup conflicts, each emotion is",,
,,,linked to a separate behavioral intent: whereas fear is generally,,
,,,associated with moving away (avoidance) from the,,
,,,"threatening out-group, anger is generally associated with",,
,,,"moving toward (attack) the threatening agent, or towards",,
,,,whoever is perceived to be responsible for not eliminating,,
,,,"the threat (Cheung-Blunden &Blunden, 2008;Halperin,",,
,,,"2015). In terms of direct and indirect political aggression,",,
,,,fear of the rival in conflict is expected to be associated with,,
,,,exclusion and distancing from the members of the rival,,
,,,"group, whereas anger towards the rival is expected to be",,
,,,associated with direct forms of political aggression.,,
,,,Considering the important role of militaristic attitudes,,
,,,and emotions in predicting different types of aggression in,,
,,,"the context of protracted conflict, we examine their role as",,
,,,potential explanatory mechanisms in the relationship,,
,,,"between gender and support for political aggression,",,
,,,alongside threat perceptions and political orientation.,,
,,,"In Study 2, we therefore examine the role of gender in",,
,,,"predicting direct and indirect political aggression, controlling",,
,,,"for the effects of political orientation, threat perceptions,",,
,,,"militarism, and emotions towards the rival in",,
,,,"conflict. Consistent with the results of Study 1, we predict",,
,,,that gender will not predict support for direct political,,
,,,"aggression in the context of protracted conflict, but will",,
,,,"significantly predict support for indirect political aggression,",,
,,,even when controlling for other central predictors.,,
,,,We expect that insignificant gender differences in militarism,,
,,,in the context of protracted conflict may function as,,
,,,potential explanation for the absence of gender differences,,
,,,"in support for direct political aggression. In addition, given",,
,,,the strong empirical link between anger towards the rival in,,
,,,"conflict and direct political aggression (Halperin, 2015),",,
,,,and insofar as anger predicts men’s and women’s support,,
,,,"for direct political aggression equally well, we expect that",,
,,,similarity in the levels of anger amongmen and women can,,
,,,account for gender similarities in support for direct political,,
,,,"aggression. Finally, given the strong empirical link between",,
,,,"fear and indirect political aggression (Halperin, 2015), we",,
,,,also contend that fear of the rival in conflictmay play a role,,
,,,in explaining the gender gap in support for indirect political,,
,,,"aggression, in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.",,
,,,"More specifically, gender differences in support for indirect",,
,,,political aggression may be attributed to differences in the,,
,,,extent to which women’s andmen’s support for this type of,,
,,,political aggression is driven by fear. Women are often,,
,,,constructed in the discourse of groups in conflict as particularly,,
,,,"targeted, vulnerable, and in need of protection (Elshtain,",,
,,,1987). If women internalize this sense of enhanced,,
,,,"vulnerability, it is possible that we might find higher prevalence",,
,,,of fear among women in the context of conflict.,,

,,,Study 1. The final sample consisted of 807 respondents.7,,
,,,Because the research was conducted with additional aims,,
,,,"in mind, the findings for the present study are exploratory.",,
,,,We designed a closed-ended questionnaire incorporating,,
,,,the following measures:,,

,,,using the same three items used in Study 1 ( ¼ .69).,,
,,,Support for indirect political aggression was assessed,,
,,,using the four-item measure of Exclusionism towards,,
,,,PCIs that used in Study 1 ( ¼ .74).,,
,,,Threat perceptions were measured using the same,,
,,,three-item scale used in Study 1 ( ¼ .88).,,
,,,Emotions towards the rival in conflict were assessed,,

,,,their leaders make participants feel fear and anger. Participants,,
,,,were asked to rate the degree to which they were,,
,,,feeling fear/anger on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly,,
,,,agree) scale. Single-item measurement has been used in,,

,,,9 Following previous studies on gender differences in attitudes,,
,,,"(Harteveld et al., 2015; Lietaert et al., 2015), we also examined",,
,,,whether gender differences in the level of fear of PCIs can explain,,
,,,the gender gap in support for indirect political aggression (i.e.,,
,,,"mediation hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a",,
,,,"two-step hierarchical linear regression analysis. In the first step,",,
,,,"exclusionism was regressed on gender, controlling for the",,
,,,demographic covariates. This analysis revealed a significant main,,
,,,"effect for gender (B ¼ .30, SE ¼ .10, b ¼ .11, t ¼ 3.01, p ¼",,
,,,".003), such that women report higher exclusionism than men. In",,
,,,"the second step, fear of PCIs was also entered as a predictor of",,
,,,"exclusionism, significantly reducing the regression coefficient of",,
,,,"gender (B ¼ .11, SE ¼ .10, b ¼ .04, t ¼ 1.10, p ¼ .271). These",,
,,,results suggest that the gender gap in exclusionism may be attributed,,
,,,to differences in the distribution of fear of PCIs among men and,,
,,,"women, further supporting the role of fear as an explanatory",,
,,,mechanism underlying the gender gap in support for indirect,,
,,,political aggression.,,
,,,Ben Shitrit et al. 741,,
,,,The findings of Study 2 provide further support for,,
,,,the hypothesized gender gap in support for indirect,,
,,,political aggression (with women more supportive of,,
,,,"exclusionism than men), and the hypothesized similarity",,
,,,"in women’s and men’s support for direct political aggression,",,
,,,"in the context of protracted conflict. Furthermore,",,
,,,these findings shed more light on mechanisms that can,,
,,,potentially explain these gender differences (or lack,,
,,,thereof). Alongside the potential role of threat perceptions,,
,,,and right-wing political orientation in explaining,,
,,,the lack of gender differences in direct political aggression,,
,,,"(replicated in both studies), the findings of Study 2",,
,,,suggest that (1) fear of PCIs affects women’s support for,,
,,,indirect political aggression more than men’s. Insofar as,,
,,,women reported more fear of PCIs than men (as indicated,,
,,,"by the bivariate correlations), this difference can",,
,,,account for women’s higher support for indirect political,,
,,,aggression; (2) anger towards PCIs and militarism can,,
,,,shed more light on why women and men do not differ in,,
,,,their support for direct political aggression. As men and,,
,,,"women report similar levels of anger towards PCIs, as",,
,,,well as similar levels of militarism (indicated by the,,
,,,"bivariate correlations), and insofar as their support for",,
,,,direct political aggression is equally affected by these,,
,,,"variables, they can both potentially account for this",,
,,,absence of a gender gap.,,
,,,Discussion,,
,,,This article emphasizes the complex association between,,
,,,gender and support for different types of political aggression,,
,,,in the context of protracted conflict. Our findings,,
,,,suggest that gender has a unique effect on indirect forms,,
,,,of political aggression in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian,,
,,,"conflict, so that women are more supportive of",,
,,,social distancing and exclusion towards PCIs as compared,,
,,,"to men. Nevertheless, women and men did not",,
,,,differ in their support for direct political aggression,,
,,,against government officials.,,
,,,One way of explaining these findings is to suggest that,,
,,,women become just as politically aggressive as men in,,
,,,"contexts of protracted intergroup conflict; just as men,",,
,,,"they are susceptible to rising threat perceptions, more",,
,,,"hawkish political orientations, militaristic attitudes, and",,
,,,"anger towards the rival in conflict, all of which are considered",,
,,,significant predictors of direct forms of political,,
,,,"aggression in the extant literature. Yet, as the feminist",,
,,,"literature has shown, in conflict contexts women are",,
,,,often constructed as uniquely vulnerable targets in need,,
,,,"of protection from the rival group, and are assigned the",,
,,,additional role of ‘boundary markers’ and symbolic ‘border,,
,,,guards’ that socially separate one community from its,,
,,,‘other’. This link between a sense of vulnerability and,,
,,,"fear of the other, for which separation, distancing, and",,
,,,marking boundaries is often presented as an answer in,,
,,,"communalist discourse, might explain our results. Indirect",,
,,,"political aggression is an acceptable, socially sanctioned",,
,,,way in which women can address the fear they have been,,
,,,conditioned to feel toward the ‘other’. The findings of the,,
,,,present research augment our understanding of the ways,,
,,,in which gender and aggression intersect in violent conflicts.,,
,,,Our distinction between direct political aggression,,
,,,"on the one hand, and indirect aggression on the other,",,
,,,sheds light on important gendered dynamics that would,,
,,,otherwise have remained obscure.,,

,,,"Notwithstanding its limitations, our research builds",,
,,,on the established literature straddling feminist theory,,
,,,and issues of political aggression and violent conflicts. To,,
,,,"the best of our knowledge, we are the first to undertake a",,
,,,systematic quantitative examination of the association,,
,,,between gender and political aggression of both direct,,
,,,"and indirect forms, in the context of protracted conflict.",,
,,,There are two ways in which this article complements,,
,,,"the feminist literature. First, most of the existing work on",,
,,,"this subject is based on qualitative case studies, rather",,
,,,than large-N quantitative research.10 Our article demonstrates,,
,,,that theory and insight developed in this literature,,
,,,find significant support also when examined through a,,
,,,"quantitative lens. In addition, the existing research on",,
,,,gender and group identity in conflict has generally,,
,,,focused on the way women are ‘used’ as targets of nationalist,,
,,,discourses that seek to recruit them to the role of,,
,,,symbolically erecting boundaries between rival groups.,,
,,,Our research shows that women are active agents in this,,
,,,process. Possibly due to the fear of group identity boundary,,
,,,"trespassing, which hegemonic communalist discourses",,
,,,"instill in women, they themselves, more than",,
,,,"men, seem to support ideas of group separation, exclusion,",,
,,,and social distance.,,
,,,"On the practical level, our research points to the",,
,,,importance of understanding women’s role in the development,,
,,,of peace in situations of ongoing conflict.,,
,,,Understanding how gender interplays with different,,
,,,forms of political aggression will help researchers and,,
,,,policymakers to better grasp the causes of aggression and,,
,,,form nuanced and long-lasting solutions to conflict,,
,,,"(Aolain, Haynes & Cahn, 2011; Vogel, Porter &",,
,,,"Kebbell, 2014). Overlooking or underestimating",,
,,,"women’s experiences and roles in political aggression,",,
,,,"particularly within settings of protracted conflict, may",,
,,,result in isolating them post-conflict and cause destabilization,,
,,,or a challenge to peace-consolidation efforts,,
,,,"(Mackenzie, 2012; Mazurana & Carlson, 2004;",,
,,,"McEvoy, 2009; Thomas & Bond, 2015). Our findings",,
,,,question the targeting of men in attempts to address and,,
,,,"reduce acts of direct political aggression, or support",,
,,,"thereof. As our findings suggest, women and men do",,
,,,"not differ in their support for direct political aggression,",,
,,,and thus may both have a role in facilitating public,,
,,,support for such acts. Addressing gender differences in,,
,,,support for and participation in indirect forms of political,,
,,,aggression is another crucial lesson arising from this,,
,,,"study, which should inform conflict resolution and",,
,,,peacebuilding efforts that seek to address not only direct,,
,,,"aggression, but also its attendant social forms in intergroup",,
,,,conflict situations.,,
,,,"Finally, examination of the Israeli case illuminates",,
,,,much more than just the fact that women bear no essential,,
,,,relationship to peace and nonviolence. It is crucial to,,
,,,consider that men and women may possess similar motivations,,
,,,for supporting certain forms of political aggression,,
,,,"(direct aggression), while holding different",,
,,,motivations to support and engage in other forms of,,
,,,aggression (indirect) in the context of violent conflicts.,,
,,,"Thus, as women’s political activity and agency increases",,
,,,"throughout the world, understanding contextual genderbased",,
,,,similarities and differences in support for different,,
,,,types of political aggression is crucial.,,
